* Project title: Dispersal promotes  stability and persistence of exploited yeast mutualisms
* Authors: Cong Liu and Mayra Vidal
* Date: Nov, 2024
* Project summary: In this study, we used a synthetic mutualism formed by genetically modified budding yeast to investigate the effect of dispersal on the persistence and stability of mutualisms under exploitation. We found that dispersal increased the persistence of exploited mutualisms by 80% compared to the isolated systems. Furthermore, our results showed that dispersal increased local diversity, decreased beta diversity among local communities, and stabilized community structure at the regional scale
* Repo description: This repo includes R codes for all the statistical analyses for the study.
